## Loop-Based Programs

This repository contains 20 Python programs designed to practice and improve skills in using loops. Below is a summary of each program included:

1. **Print Numbers from 1 to 20**: Uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 20.

2. **Print Even Numbers from 1 to 50**: Uses a `while` loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 50.

3. **Sum of All Numbers Between 1 and 100**: Calculates and prints the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

4. **Multiplication Table**: Takes a user-inputted number and prints its multiplication table using a `for` loop.

5. **Print Odd Numbers from 1 to 100**: Uses a loop to print all odd numbers between 1 and 100.

6. **Print Each Character of a String**: Iterates through a string and prints each character.

7. **Factorial Using a While Loop**: Calculates the factorial of a given number using a `while` loop.

8. **Print Numbers from 10 to 1**: Uses a `for` loop to print numbers in descending order from 10 to 1.

9. **Print First 10 Fibonacci Numbers**: Generates and prints the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

10. **Count Number of Digits in an Integer**: Uses a loop to count and display the number of digits in an integer input.

11. **Print Reverse of a Given Number**: Reverses and prints the digits of an inputted number using a loop.

12. **Print Prime Numbers Between 1 and 50**: Uses a loop to find and print all prime numbers in the range of 1 to 50.

13. **Pyramid Pattern of ***: Uses nested loops to print a pyramid pattern using `*`.

14. **Break a Loop with a Condition**: Demonstrates the use of the `break` statement when a specific condition is met.

15. **Sum of Even and Odd Numbers**: Calculates and prints the sum of even and odd numbers separately up to a given number.

16. **Sum of the Digits of an Integer**: Takes an inputted integer and calculates the sum of its digits using a loop.

17. **Number Guessing Game**: Continuously prompts the user for a number until the correct number is guessed, demonstrating the `while` loop with a condition.

18. **Print Numbers in Reverse Order**: Uses a loop to print numbers in reverse order within a user-defined range.

19. **Print Squares of Numbers from 1 to 10**: Uses a `for` loop to print the square of each number from 1 to 10.

20. **Countdown Timer**: Simulates a countdown timer starting from a given number down to zero.
