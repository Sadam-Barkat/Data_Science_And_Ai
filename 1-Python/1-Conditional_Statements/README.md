## Conditional Statements Programs

This repository contains 20 basic Python programs focusing on conditional statements to help practice and improve problem-solving skills. Below is a brief description of each program included:

1. **Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero**: A program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

2. **Age Classification**: Accepts a user's age and classifies them as a minor, adult, or senior citizen.

3. **Leap Year Checker**: Checks if a given year is a leap year.

4. **Even or Odd Checker**: Takes an integer input and determines if it's even or odd.

5. **Grade Percentage to Letter Grade**: Converts a user’s grade percentage to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).

6. **Find the Largest of Two Numbers**: Compares two numbers and displays the larger one.

7. **Find the Largest of Three Numbers**: Takes three numbers as input and identifies the largest.

8. **Palindrome Checker**: Checks if a given string is a palindrome.

9. **Valid Triangle Checker**: Takes three sides of a triangle and checks if they form a valid triangle.

10. **Vowel or Consonant Identifier**: Determines if a given character is a vowel or a consonant.

11. **Multiple of 3 and 5 Checker**: Checks if a given number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

12. **Temperature Evaluation**: Takes a temperature in Celsius and classifies it as freezing, moderate, or hot.

13. **Basic Calculator**: Accepts two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and performs the respective operation.

14. **Century Year Checker**: Checks if a user-inputted year is a century year.

15. **Number Within Range**: Checks if a given number is within a specified range.

16. **Triangle Classification**: Accepts three side lengths and determines if the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

17. **Divisibility Check**: Checks if an integer is divisible by 2, 3, or both.

18. **Pass or Fail**: Takes a user’s score and determines if they pass or fail (pass if 50 or above).

19. **Case Checker**: Checks if a string is in uppercase, lowercase, or a mix.

20. **Prime Number Checker**: Evaluates if an inputted number is prime.
