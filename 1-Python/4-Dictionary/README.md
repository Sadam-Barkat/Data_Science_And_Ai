# Python Dictionaries Assignment

This repository contains solutions to a comprehensive assignment on Python dictionaries, completed as part of my Data Science and AI course at **SMIT** under the guidance of **Sir Ahmad Jajja**. The assignment covers a wide range of dictionary operations, from basic to advanced, including real-world applications and challenging problems.

## Assignment Overview

### Basic Operations
- Create and manipulate dictionaries with keys like `name`, `age`, and `grade`.
- Add, update, and remove key-value pairs dynamically.
- Access specific values using keys.

### Iterating Through Dictionaries
- Iterate through keys, values, and key-value pairs.
- Check for key existence and count total keys.

### Advanced Dictionary Usage
- Merge multiple dictionaries.
- Create dictionaries from tuples and sort them.
- Reverse dictionaries by swapping keys and values.
- Check if two dictionaries are identical.

### Nested Dictionaries
- Model real-world data structures with nested dictionaries.
- Access, add, and delete nested elements.
- Iterate through outer-level keys.

### Applications of Dictionaries
- Count word occurrences in a string.
- Identify the key with the maximum value.
- Map numbers to their squares.
- Remove duplicate values from a dictionary.
- Write functions to handle missing keys gracefully.

### Challenging Problems
- Add values of matching keys across dictionaries.
- Flatten nested dictionaries into a single level.
- Use dictionary comprehensions to filter data.
- Split a dictionary into two based on odd and even values.

## Key Learnings
- Efficiently handling and manipulating Python dictionaries.
- Applying dictionary operations to solve real-world problems.
- Strengthening problem-solving skills in Python.
